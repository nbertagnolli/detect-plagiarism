# Spot Plagiarism

This repostiory holds some very simple javascript for detecting if a given writing sample came from a human or a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT.  Please visit [www.spotplagiarism.com](www.spotplagiarism.com) to interact with the application.

# Design
The system was built to run client side.  I wanted to try and approach the problem of identifying machine text in a way that would be easy to host and cheap to maintain.  The system works by using a quantized version of DistilGPT to calculate the perplexity of a given input text.
